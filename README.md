# About

This repository contains algorithms for computing the value of pi (Ï€), from infinte summations and products to binary digit extraction algorithms.

# Sources

I use the following websites as my sources for finding new algorithms to implement
    - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_formulae_involving_%CF%80#Efficient_infinite_series

# Comparision of Algorithms

Here is a table comparing of all the algorithms I have implemented thus far. A more detailed version is included in the wiki page by the same name as this heading.

# More information about each algorithm

More infomration about each algorithm (such as graphs and mathematical representations) is included in each algorithm's folder. Check the wiki for more information.
